The current activity of the BioDeposit project is related to the planting of olive plantations.</p>\n      <p class="faq-card__desc">\n      The olive business is highly profitable, although it has remained closed for many years. Until now, it was not available to ordinary investors. The BioDeposit project provides access to it to any investor, regardless of the geography of residence and regardless of the amount of investment.\n      </p>\n      <p class="faq-card__desc">\n      The essence of the BioDeposit project is that anyone anywhere in the world, regardless of their country of residence, can become the owner of an olive tree growing in Georgia and receive a harvest every year.\n      </p>'},card2:{title:"Why did we choose olives?",content:"Today, olive trees are recognized as one of the most profitable types of bio asset. They are able to live and bear fruit for hundreds of years. It is logical that the BioDeposit project was decided to be built around olives."},card3:{title:"Who is in charge of the project?",content:"BioDeposit is a project of Agromine JSC. The company is based in Georgia, where the project team has been planting olive plantations for more than 8 years."},card4:{title:"Why was not chosen Spain, Greece or some other country for which olives are a traditional crop?",content:"In Georgia, in addition to a suitable climate and fertile soil, there is also a favorable economic component: state support, preferential taxation for agricultural producers, as well as lower costs for cultivation, care and processing."},card5:{title:"Why did the project come into being right now?",content:"As already mentioned, thanks to the rapid growth of the economy and the program of state support, there are especially favorable conditions for the olive business in Georgia today. But no less important here is the role of new digital technologies that have become widespread in recent years, have significantly expanded the possibilities of online business and made it possible to implement our idea technically."},card6:{title:"What are the business prospects?",content:"Demand for quality olive oil exceeds supply, and the amount that can be grown in Georgia is a drop in the bucket compared to global consumption. So there are no sales issues."},card7:{title:"What is the minimum investment amount?",content:"The base price of one young olive tree (which should be considered a seedling that has not reached 12 months from the date of planting) is $118. As the tree grows, so does its price."},card8:{title:"How can I become a plantation owner?",content:'<p class="faq-card__desc">\n      To own a tree or even an entire plantation in Georgia, you do not need to be a citizen of this country.

What happens if my tree dies?",content:'<p class="faq-card__desc">\n      Very rare It happens that young trees do not take root. The risks identified by our consultants (international experts with many years of experience) do not exceed 2-3%. As for our investors, they do not risk anything, because for each plantation we form a special guarantee fund - additional trees with a threefold margin.\n      </p>\n    <p class="faq-card__desc">\n      Each of our plantations is 20 hectares planted with 12,000 olives. 11 thousand trees go on sale, another thousand constitute the reserve fund. If something happens to your tree, you will get exactly the same from the fund. It will be an olive of the same age and harvest. The only thing that will change for you is the coordinates of the tree inside the plantation.\n      </p>\n    <p class="faq-card__desc">\n      We take full responsibility for the safety of the tree during the first three years (insurance and tree care included in the base price). Starting from the fourth year, when the tree begins to bear fruit, you can insure the tree against any force majeure with an independent insurance company.\n      </p>'},card10:{title:"What determines the value of a tree?",content:"The older the tree, the higher its value. In the period from the 4th to the 10th year, the amount of profit increases due to the harvest brought by the tree. Accordingly, the cost of the bio asset also increases. When the tree reaches 10 years of age, the growth in value stops."},card11:{title:"What is BioDeposit's benefit?",content:"By selling trees, we pursue several goals:\n      - Expansion of the plantation to obtain a raw material base and the production of olive products;\n      - Providing our own service company with a constant income (because we get part of your harvest);\n      - Greening the planet (thanks to one tree, two people can breathe);\n      - Promotion of olive oil.\n      "},card12:{title:"Are olives the only bio asset that brings big profits?",content:"Not the only one. We are exploring all types of profitable bio-assets and it is possible that in the future we will also include them in the BioDeposit project."},card13:{title:"Have the trees already been planted or is this still to be done?",content:"The trees have already been planted. This is done for the convenience of investors. By purchasing not a seedling, but a young tree, you will quickly begin to receive a harvest from it."},card14:{title:"Can I give my tree to someone as a present?",content:"Certainly. And not just as a gift. For the Biodeposit project, we have developed a number of legally protected options, which, in addition to gifting, also include the possibility of donation (charity) and inheritance."},card15:{title:"Can I pick up my tree?",content:"Plantation sites were carefully selected by agricultural specialists so that each tree would grow where nature and man created the best conditions for this. But if the owner of an olive tree wants to dig it up and transplant it, say, to his summer cottage, then there are no technical obstacles for this."},card16:{title:"If I want to buy many trees at once, can I count on the wholesale price?",content:"If you are ready to buy more than 3 thousand olive trees, then special conditions apply to you, which you can find out about by filling out the form on this page."}},difference:{title:"A NOBLE BUSINESS <span>YOU WILL LEAVE </span>TO YOUR DESCENDANTS",yearFoundation:"BioDeposit <span>since 2017</span>"},copyright:"©2023 BioDeposit.
